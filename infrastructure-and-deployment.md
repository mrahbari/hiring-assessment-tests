Infrastructure and deployment:

### Questions:

1. **What is your experience with server setup and configuration for PHP applications?**
   - Discuss your experience with setting up and configuring servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx) for PHP applications. Mention your familiarity with server environments (e.g., Linux, Windows), load balancing, and the configuration of services such as database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - You can talk about how you optimize performance using caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Varnish) and configure security settings such as SSL certificates.

2. **How do you manage deployments and rollbacks for web applications?**
   - Highlight your approach to deploying code, ensuring minimal downtime, and dealing with issues like traffic spikes.
   - Discuss strategies for rolling back changes if there’s a deployment failure (e.g., automated rollback procedures, maintaining snapshots, or versioning strategies).
   - Explain tools or strategies used, such as Git version control for tracking changes and automated pipelines for deployment.

3. **Can you describe a typical workflow for deploying a PHP application in a production environment?**
   - Detail the process you follow from development to production. This could include:
     - Writing and testing code locally or in staging environments.
     - Running tests through CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).
     - Packaging and deploying the application using tools like Docker or Kubernetes, or via tools like Capistrano for PHP apps.
     - Final touches like clearing caches, database migrations, and load balancing.

### Topics:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible):**
   - Be ready to discuss if you’ve used any IaC tools like **Terraform**, **Ansible**, or **CloudFormation** to automate the provisioning and configuration of servers.
   - Mention how using IaC ensures consistency across environments (dev, staging, production) and allows you to manage infrastructure declaratively.

2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices:**
   - Discuss how you’ve integrated CI/CD pipelines in your PHP projects to automate testing, build, and deployment.
   - Tools like **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI**, or **CircleCI** help ensure code quality through automated tests and trigger automated deployments after successful builds.
   - Mention strategies like blue-green deployments, canary releases, and the benefits of fast feedback loops with CI/CD.

3. **Use of containers (Docker) in the deployment pipeline:**
   - Talk about your experience using **Docker** for containerizing PHP applications, ensuring consistency between development, testing, and production environments.
   - Highlight how Docker simplifies dependency management, isolation, and scalability.
   - Mention if you’ve worked with container orchestration platforms like **Kubernetes** or tools like **Docker Compose** for managing multi-container environments.

### Additional Topics:
- **Monitoring and logging**: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for performance monitoring and issue tracking.
- **Cloud services**: Experience with cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Azure, and setting up PHP apps with services like Elastic Beanstalk or managed databases.
- **Security best practices**: Securing PHP applications through practices like SSL/TLS, firewalls, and regular updates.

Being familiar with these areas will help you have a productive conversation with the system administrator, bridging your PHP expertise with their infrastructure knowledge.
