Application-level caching involves storing static or frequently accessed data in memory during the lifecycle of a request, reducing the need for repeated database queries or expensive operations within the same request. 





**Singleton Pattern**
   You can use the Singleton design pattern to ensure that static data is loaded only once and reused in various parts of your application.

   #### Example:
   ```php
   class CategoryCache {
       private static $instance = null;
       private $categories = null;

       // Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation
       private function __construct() {
           $this->categories = DB::table('categories')->get(); // Query DB only once
       }

       // Static method to get the singleton instance
       public static function getInstance() {
           if (self::$instance === null) {
               self::$instance = new CategoryCache();
           }
           return self::$instance;
       }

       public function getCategories() {
           return $this->categories;
       }
   }

   // Usage
   $categoryCache = CategoryCache::getInstance();
   $menuCategories = $categoryCache->getCategories();
   $sidebarCategories = $categoryCache->getCategories();
   ```

   This ensures the categories are only fetched once in the request, and the same data is used wherever needed.

### 3. **Dependency Injection with Service Containers (Laravel Example)**
   If youâ€™re working with a PHP framework like Laravel, you can use the service container to handle application-level caching.

   #### Example in Laravel:
   You can bind a service in the container that caches data during a request:

   ```php
   // In a service provider (AppServiceProvider)
   public function register() {
       $this->app->singleton('CachedCategories', function ($app) {
           return DB::table('categories')->get(); // Cached in the container for the duration of the request
       });
   }

   // In your controller
   public function showPage() {
       $categories = app('CachedCategories'); // Reuse the cached data
       return view('page', compact('categories'));
   }
   ```

   Here, Laravel will store the categories in the service container, ensuring that even across different controllers or views, the data is only queried once per request.
   
   
   
   
   
By using application-level caching, you can significantly reduce redundant database queries within the same request, speeding up the application and enhancing performance.
