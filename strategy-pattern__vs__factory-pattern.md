The **Strategy Pattern** and **Factory Pattern** are both common design patterns in PHP (and other programming languages), but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.

### 1. **Strategy Pattern**
The Strategy Pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms (strategies), encapsulate each one as a separate class, and make them interchangeable. The main goal is to decouple the algorithm from the context (or object) that uses it.

#### Key Characteristics:
- Focuses on how a task is performed.
- Allows selecting an algorithm at runtime.
- Encapsulates algorithms in separate classes, making them interchangeable.

#### Example (Strategy Pattern in PHP):

Imagine you are working on a payment system, and you want to support different payment methods like PayPal, CreditCard, or BankTransfer.

```php
// Step 1: Define an interface for the strategy
interface PaymentStrategy {
    public function pay(int $amount);
}

// Step 2: Create concrete strategies implementing the interface
class PayPalStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    public function pay(int $amount) {
        echo "Paying $amount using PayPal.\n";
    }
}

class CreditCardStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    public function pay(int $amount) {
        echo "Paying $amount using Credit Card.\n";
    }
}

// Step 3: Context class that uses a strategy
class PaymentContext {
    private PaymentStrategy $strategy;

    // Inject the chosen strategy
    public function __construct(PaymentStrategy $strategy) {
        $this->strategy = $strategy;
    }

    public function executePayment(int $amount) {
        $this->strategy->pay($amount);
    }
}

// Step 4: Usage
$paymentMethod = new PayPalStrategy(); // Can be switched at runtime
$context = new PaymentContext($paymentMethod);
$context->executePayment(100);
```

Here, you can switch between different payment methods (strategies) dynamically.

### 2. **Factory Pattern**
The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses or concrete factory classes to decide which class to instantiate. The main goal of the Factory Pattern is to abstract the process of object creation.

#### Key Characteristics:
- Focuses on object creation.
- Centralizes object instantiation logic.
- Allows you to decouple the client code from the specific object creation.

#### Example (Factory Pattern in PHP):

Let's say you want to create different types of notifications: Email, SMS, or Push notifications.

```php
// Step 1: Define an interface for products
interface Notification {
    public function send(string $message);
}

// Step 2: Create concrete products
class EmailNotification implements Notification {
    public function send(string $message) {
        echo "Sending email: $message\n";
    }
}

class SMSNotification implements Notification {
    public function send(string $message) {
        echo "Sending SMS: $message\n";
    }
}

// Step 3: Create a factory to generate objects
class NotificationFactory {
    public static function createNotification(string $type): Notification {
        switch ($type) {
            case 'email':
                return new EmailNotification();
            case 'sms':
                return new SMSNotification();
            default:
                throw new Exception("Notification type not supported.");
        }
    }
}

// Step 4: Usage
$notification = NotificationFactory::createNotification('email');
$notification->send("Hello from the factory pattern!");
```

Here, the factory (`NotificationFactory`) encapsulates the creation of the objects, allowing you to instantiate `EmailNotification` or `SMSNotification` without knowing the details in the client code.

### Differences Between Strategy and Factory Patterns in PHP:

| **Aspect**                 | **Strategy Pattern**                                                 | **Factory Pattern**                                                   |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                 | To define multiple algorithms and allow switching between them dynamically at runtime. | To centralize object creation logic and abstract the instantiation process. |
| **Focus**                   | Behavior and algorithms (how a task is performed).                   | Object creation (what object to create).                              |
| **Responsibility**          | Encapsulates interchangeable behaviors or algorithms.               | Decides which class to instantiate based on input or configuration.   |
| **Usage**                   | When you have multiple algorithms or behaviors and want to choose between them dynamically. | When you need to manage complex object creation logic.                |
| **Example Scenario**        | Choosing between different payment methods.                         | Creating different types of notifications (Email, SMS, Push, etc.).   |

### Key Takeaway:
- Use the **Strategy Pattern** when you want to dynamically change the behavior or algorithm in your system (like choosing between different payment strategies).
- Use the **Factory Pattern** when you want to centralize object creation and simplify the process of instantiating different classes (like creating notifications or other objects based on type).
