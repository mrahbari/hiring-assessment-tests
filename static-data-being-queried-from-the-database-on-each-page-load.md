To optimize static data being queried from the database on each page load, I would take the following approach:

### 1. **Implement Caching**
   - **Server-side caching**: Use tools like Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed static data. By doing so, you can avoid unnecessary database queries and serve data from the cache, improving response times.
   - **Query result caching**: In PHP frameworks like Laravel, you can cache database query results for a defined period using the `Cache` facade.
     ```php
     $data = Cache::remember('static_data_key', 3600, function() {
         return DB::table('your_table')->get();
     });
     ```
   - **Application-level caching**: Store static data in the application's memory to reduce repeated queries during a single request lifecycle.

### 2. **Database Optimization**
   - **Optimize queries**: Ensure that queries fetching static data are properly indexed and optimized.
   - **Use a dedicated read replica**: For high-load systems, I might set up a read replica to distribute the load and ensure static data queries don't affect the primary database.

### 3. **CDN for Static Content**
   - If the static data involves media or assets (e.g., images or files), serving these through a CDN can drastically reduce database and server load.

By applying caching mechanisms and optimizing how static data is retrieved and stored, you can significantly reduce unnecessary database hits and improve overall performance.

-------------------------------

Application-level caching involves storing static or frequently accessed data in memory during the lifecycle of a request, reducing the need for repeated database queries or expensive operations within the same request. This type of caching is temporary and only lasts for the duration of the request, meaning once the request is completed, the cached data is discarded.

Here’s more information and examples of how application-level caching can be applied in a PHP context:

### 1. **Use of Variables for Repeated Data**
   In a typical PHP application, if you are querying the same static data multiple times within a single request, you can store the data in a variable and reuse it.

   #### Example:
   Suppose you're loading the list of categories multiple times in a request, like during rendering a menu and a sidebar.

   ```php
   // First time loading categories from DB
   $categories = null;

   // Function to get categories, checking if it's already loaded
   function getCategories() {
       global $categories;
       if (!$categories) {
           // Assume this is a DB query
           $categories = DB::table('categories')->get();
       }
       return $categories;
   }

   // Usage in the same request
   $menuCategories = getCategories(); // Will query DB if not loaded
   $sidebarCategories = getCategories(); // Will reuse the $categories variable
   ```

   In this case, the categories are only fetched once, and subsequent calls within the same request will reuse the cached data in memory.

### 2. **Singleton Pattern**
   You can use the Singleton design pattern to ensure that static data is loaded only once and reused in various parts of your application.

   #### Example:
   ```php
   class CategoryCache {
       private static $instance = null;
       private $categories = null;

       // Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation
       private function __construct() {
           $this->categories = DB::table('categories')->get(); // Query DB only once
       }

       // Static method to get the singleton instance
       public static function getInstance() {
           if (self::$instance === null) {
               self::$instance = new CategoryCache();
           }
           return self::$instance;
       }

       public function getCategories() {
           return $this->categories;
       }
   }

   // Usage
   $categoryCache = CategoryCache::getInstance();
   $menuCategories = $categoryCache->getCategories();
   $sidebarCategories = $categoryCache->getCategories();
   ```

   This ensures the categories are only fetched once in the request, and the same data is used wherever needed.

### 3. **Dependency Injection with Service Containers (Laravel Example)**
   If you’re working with a PHP framework like Laravel, you can use the service container to handle application-level caching.

   #### Example in Laravel:
   You can bind a service in the container that caches data during a request:

   ```php
   // In a service provider (AppServiceProvider)
   public function register() {
       $this->app->singleton('CachedCategories', function ($app) {
           return DB::table('categories')->get(); // Cached in the container for the duration of the request
       });
   }

   // In your controller
   public function showPage() {
       $categories = app('CachedCategories'); // Reuse the cached data
       return view('page', compact('categories'));
   }
   ```

   Here, Laravel will store the categories in the service container, ensuring that even across different controllers or views, the data is only queried once per request.

### 4. **Session-Based or Request-Specific In-Memory Cache**
   Sometimes, you can leverage the **session** or **request** state to cache static data for re-use, ensuring it doesn’t hit the database multiple times in the same request cycle.

   #### Example:
   In some cases, you can store data in the session to avoid repeated queries across multiple page requests:

   ```php
   if (!session()->has('categories')) {
       session(['categories' => DB::table('categories')->get()]);
   }

   $categories = session('categories');
   ```

   Although this persists data across requests (until the session expires), it can be useful in reducing repeated queries for static data that changes infrequently.

### When to Use Application-Level Caching:
   - **Low complexity:** It's relatively easy to implement and works within the lifespan of a request.
   - **Prevents redundant DB calls:** Especially useful when the same data is queried multiple times in different parts of the code during a single request.
   - **Stateless environments:** Useful in scenarios where more complex caching strategies (like Redis) are overkill for temporary or request-specific data.
   - **Avoids external dependencies:** Since it's within the application, there’s no need for additional services like Redis, making it lightweight.

### Limitations:
   - **Short lifespan:** Since it's only available within the request, this form of caching doesn’t persist data across multiple requests.
   - **Limited to individual requests:** Once the request ends, the data is discarded, and you need to reload it if requested again.
   - **Memory consumption:** Large datasets cached in memory within a single request can lead to high memory usage if not handled carefully.

By using application-level caching, you can significantly reduce redundant database queries within the same request, speeding up the application and enhancing performance.
